## Communication

We're always around for a chat in our public Gitter channel: https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way

In addition, you can reach the team members through their preferred way of communication:
- Kirstie Whitaker: Mention me on a Github issue or pull request ([@KirstieJane](https://github.com/KirstieJane)), or tag me in [Gitter](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), `@KirstieJane`.
  Don't be afraid to nudge if I've not replied after a day or two! :sparkling_heart:
- Malvika Sharan: Not full time on the project until mid-January 2020, but available by email 1 day per week at [msharan@turing.ac.uk](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk)

The following people are no longer paid to work on the project (although they remain very valuable members of the community!)
You can request contact information through the named team members above, or tag them in the [Turing Way Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) so others can answer if the folks you're looking for are not around.

- Rachael Ainsworth
- Becky Arnold
- Louise Bowler
- Sarah Gibson
- Patricia Herterich
- Rosie Higman
- Anna Krystalli
- Alex Morley
- Martin O'Reilly

As most team members do not work full time on the _Turing Way_, it might take some time until your query or contribution is addressed - especially if expert knowledge is needed.
You can join members of the core team and the wider Turing Way community at our twice-monthly [Collaboration Cafes](project_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md), which are great places to discuss ideas for new contributions and to get started with making them :rocket:

## Project management

### Issues
- Once completed, issues should be closed immediately. By adding "closes #issue" or [something similar](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in a comment on a pull request, merging the pull request will close the issue automatically.
- The team will have a weekly catch up to go triage on open issues, update the project board and agree on priorities for the next week.

### Pull requests
- Pull requests should be reviewed in a timely manner.
- When reviewing a pull request, please do not use the "request a change" function but comment on the change or make a pull request to the file that should be merged.

## Commitments
All The Turing Way team members commit to
- making the implicit explicit by documenting their work
- dedicating time to update contribution guidelines and other core documents needed to facilitate collaboration
- feed back on issues in open source software used throughout the Turing Way by opening an issue in those open source packages and trying to fix them (including documentation)
