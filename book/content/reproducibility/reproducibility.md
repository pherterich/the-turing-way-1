# What is reproducible science?

## Prerequisites / recommended skill level
No previous knowledge needed.

## Table of contents

1. [Why reproducibility is important for science](01/importantforscience)
2. [Why you should care about reproducibility](02/whycare)
3. [Definitions of reproducibility](03/definitions)
4. [Resources for reproducibility chapter](04/resources)

## Summary
There are several definitions of reproducibility in use, and we discuss these in more detail in the [definitions](03/definitions) section of this chapter.
The Turing Way defines reproducibility as data and code being available to fully rerun the analysis.
This chapter will lay out why reproducibility is important for science and scientists, provide an overview of the most common definitions, and define reproducibility in the context of this handbook.

## How this will help you / why this is useful
This chapter sets out the definition of reproducibility that the Turing Way project team used when writing this handbook.
It will be useful to avoid misunderstandings when reading the rest of the handbook.
