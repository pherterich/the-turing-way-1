### Abstract

**Title:** Reproducible Research: An Introduction to _The Turing Way_ and Binder

Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted.
Funders and stakeholders are beginning to require that publications and research outreach include access to the underlying data and analysis code.
The goal is to ensure that all results can be independently verified and built upon in future work.
This is sometimes easier said than done!
Sharing these research outputs means understanding data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques.
_The Turing Way_ is a handbook to support research professionals, stakeholders, students and their supervisors, and funders in ensuring that reproducible research is “too easy not to do”.
It includes training material on version control, analysis testing, and open and transparent communication with future users.
This project is openly developed and any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way.

One tool _The Turing Way_ recommends using is Project Binder (https://jupyter.org/binder), the free and public version of which is hosted at https://mybinder.org.
This project uses openly developed tools to transform a static GitHub repository, containing Jupyter Notebooks and scripts written in Python, R, Julia and other languages, into an interactive computational environment hosted in the cloud.
This environment can then be shared with anyone, anywhere via a single, clickable URL so that the analysis code and dataset can be interactively explored without the need for the user to install the software.
In this talk and hands-on tutorial, Sarah will introduce _The Turing Way_ and Binder then walk the attendees through their first Binder-ready repository on GitHub.
The tutorial materials are available here: https://bit.ly/zero-to-binder-tutorial and are suitable for all programming levels.
